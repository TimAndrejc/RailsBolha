# Bolha Mockup with Ruby on Rails
This is a mockup of the Bolha.com website, built with Ruby on Rails.
To run the app locally, run ./bin/dev in the root directory.
This app allows you to create, edit and delete ads, as well as search for ads by title category and type.
It also allows Google login.
You can set users as admins, which allows them to confirm and delete ads.

In this project I learnt quite a lot about Ruby on Rails, but I also learnt a lot about using frameworks for 
web applications.
